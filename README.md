This is the Rock Paper Scissors project from The Odin Project. This will be my first project using JS.

This is a fully workable console version of rock, paper, scissors. I thought I did well at the beginning creating the first version of the game that only required playing one round and displaying the winner of the round. 
However, when I moved on to implement a five round game. I realized how unfamiliar I was with how loops worked. So I had to watch videos on them to figure. Once my game was playing five rounds. I wanted to implement a score keeping method. I really struggled with this as well.

I found a very useful YouTube video about the project by CodingWithRob. After I tried every possibility in my limited knowledge. This video introduced me to arrays and the filter method. It made all the complex solutions I had thought up (that didn't work) into a few simple lines.
